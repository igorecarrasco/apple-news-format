Tommy Gallagher, then of Counter Culture Coffee, explained that it’s better to go to a coffee shop where the barista is trained, has dialed in the espresso already (meaning they’ve found the ideal grind size), and uses a multi-thousand–dollar machine to ensure that what you’re drinking is at least moderately good. But results are almost never the only reason to get into making espresso. If you’re interested in learning a culinary craft, an at-home espresso setup can be very rewarding. For one, it impresses your friends. Two, it can be really fun to tinker with techniques and dosage. Also, it does make for a nice ritual (this, says Gallagher, is the real appeal). And you might just prefer making your own espresso to buying one, or to drinking drip coffee instead."

The water must be the right temperature, about 195 degrees Fahrenheit—much cooler, and your espresso will be under-extracted and weak; much hotter, and it can be over-extracted and bitter. And the pressure must be constant, so that water flows evenly through the grounds. There are three different styles of machine that give you more or less control over this process:"

      "text": "When deciding which semiautomatic machines to test, we considered only single-boiler models, which use the same boiler to heat the water for the espresso shot and for the steam wand. Once you’ve pulled a shot (at a temperature of about 195 ºF), a single-boiler machine has to quickly heat itself enough to steam the milk. A dual-boiler machine has separate boilers: one set to a lower temperature for the espresso, and the other set to the higher temperature needed for the steam wand. This means that there’s no warming-up time between pulling a shot and steaming milk—experienced baristas can even steam milk while the shot is being pulled—but it also means pushing into the $1,000-plus territory. We think for beginners, it’s better to focus on one thing at a time, so the slowness of a single-boiler machine isn’t too big of an issue."

It was a hit then, and the company has changed the design very little over the decades since—though the company did move manufacturing from Italy to Romania. Similarly, Rancilio has been around since the 1920s, and its "

As Steve Rhinehart from the well-known coffee website Prima Coffee told us, “The grinder is the biggest, most important purchase you can make [when it comes to espresso].” Just like when brewing any other type of coffee, the fineness and evenness of the grounds can have a dramatic effect on how the resulting coffee tastes. If the grind is too coarse, your coffee may come out under-brewed and watery or sour; too fine and it will be over-extracted, muddy, and bitter. And if the grind is uneven, you may brew coffee with an uneven mix of both bitter and sour flavors, without much of the pleasant, middle notes."

But the quality of shots from the Silvia varied greatly, and overall we think the Infuser’s consistency made up for its not-as-high highlights. Furthermore, some coffee aficionados may be a bit miffed at the Infuser’s 54-millimeter portafilter, which is smaller than many other machines’. This odd size makes the Infuser harder to customize. For instance, many tampers don’t come with a 54 mm size—though we found that a 53 mm tamper works just fine. In contrast, both the Gaggia Classic and the Silvia had 58 mm portafilters, which are much more standard."

This meant that less coffee was able to fit into the filter, which made it difficult to pull a real double shot. In fact, we were unable to put more than 18 grams of coffee into the Silvia’s basket, and the Infuser could easily fit 19, or even 20, grams. So although the unorthodox size was a bit of a pitfall, the actual part was superior than the competition."

A pannarello wand releases air as well as steam, saving you from having to aerate the milk manually by angling the wand against the surface of the milk just so. Unfortunately, the wand on the Gaggia produced foam with large, unwieldy bubbles. Though this will make a cappuccino similar to the ones you see at old-timey Italian cafés, it won’t be up to the standards of a modern coffee boutique. Despite trying several times with different approaches, we found it impossible to foam milk with micro-bubbles, meaning latte art was simply out of the question."

The Classic is usually cheaper than the Infuser, but keep in mind that the Infuser comes with a milk-frothing pitcher, decent tamper, and a few other bonuses. The Classic comes with only a plastic tamper, and one that has more in common with the little plastic table you get in the middle of a pizza than anything you’d find behind the counter of a coffee shop. It’s basically unusable."

The Infuser is a little nicer on the eyes, and in our tests was consistent and made better foam, which makes it better for most beginners."

Instead of having one dial that’s meant to adjust the grind from coarse to fine, the Vario comes with two levers: one for larger changes in the grind size—from 1 (very fine) to 10 (coarse)—and another for micro-adjustments between each number (from A to W). If you move the grind from a lower number to a higher one, you must be sure to put the micro-adjuster to A; conversely you must put it to W when making a smaller grind. Visually this isn’t too confusing—and it does give you much more power when figuring out the right grind—but it’s a bit of a steep learning curve. Additionally, at its current price of $480 the Vario is the most expensive grinder we tested. At the same time, its results blew away the competition. So if you have a little more money to spend and intend on really honing your espresso-making craft, the Vario is the best choice. Seattle Coffee Gear has an informative "

There are whole forum posts dedicated to how hard one should press on the tamper when compressing the beans; some even say tamping is not necessary (though we disagree). Whatever you believe, it’s important to tamp the grinds evenly so that water flows through them at an even rate. You should also remain consistent in your tamping ritual for every cup of coffee you make, because the espresso will brew differently depending on how tightly the grinds are compressed. So it’s helpful to own a tamper that feels comfortable. Every machine comes with its own tamper, although some are better than others. Rancilio and Gaggia, for example, come with tiny plastic presses that are annoying to hold and anything but sturdy. The Breville’s bundled tamper, on the other hand, is pretty great."
