You will put me in trouble,” Mr. Otaibi told the agents, according to the Turkish official and a report in the Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak. Both cited audio recordings said to have been obtained by Turkish intelligence."},{"role":"body","text":"“If you want to live when you come back to Arabia, shut up,” one of the agents replied, according to both the official and the newspaper."},{"role":"body","text":"A top Saudi doctor of forensics had been brought along for the dissection and disposal of the body — an addition to the team that Turkish officials have called evidence of premeditation. And as the agents cut off Mr. Khashoggi’s head and dismembered his body, the doctor had some advice, according to the senior Turkish official."},{"role":"body","text":"Listen to music, he told them, as he donned headphones himself. That was what he did to ease the tension when doing such work, the doctor explained, according to the official describing the contents of the audio recordings."},{"role":"body","text":"Although several Turkish officials have described the audio recordings or other evidence related to Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance in the consulate, all have declined to disclose how the material was obtained. Some recordings or other evidence may have come from intercepted communications or audio surveillance that the Turkish government is unwilling to acknowledge for fear of compromising intelligence sources or revealing violations of international law."},{"role":"body","text":"But Mr. Trump’s comments suggested that the Turks have also declined to share their evidence with United States intelligence agencies, which are usually close partners. That reluctance suggests the Turkish government may be seeking to reach some accommodation with Saudi Arabia while avoiding a full rupture in relations with another important regional power."},{"role":"body","text":"The Turkish leaks implicating Saudi officials in the Khashoggi case have followed a distinctive pattern."},{"role":"body","text":"They began on Oct. 6, the day Turkish officials have said President Erdogan was first briefed on the evidence. But the flow of leaks ceased in more recent days as diplomatic steps to address the matter escalated: King Salman of Saudi Arabia called Mr. Erdogan and sent a high-level delegation. President Trump suggested that he was "},{"role":"body","text":"On Wednesday, however, the leaks resumed and escalated, a possible sign of Turkish frustration as the Saudis have delivered no such public explanation and the Trump administration has shown no rush to get one."},{"role":"body","text":"After meeting the previous night with King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed, Mr. Pompeo told reporters in Riyadh: “They made a commitment to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that. Whether they are a senior officer or official, they promised accountability.”"},{"role":"body","text":"Asked if that included members of the royal family itself, he said, “They made no exceptions.”"},{"role":"body","text":"An investigation by The New York Times revealed on Tuesday that at least four of the suspects whom Turkish officials have said played a role in Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance or death have close ties to Crown Prince Mohammed, having traveled with him as members of his security team."},{"role":"body","text":"Those four are among 15 Saudis, including the doctor of forensics, whom the Turks have said flew into Istanbul the day of Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance. The Times has confirmed that at least nine worked for the Saudi government, military or security services."},{"role":"body","text":"Mr. Pompeo has declined to comment on such specifics but has expressed confidence in the promise of the king and crown prince to investigate. After flying to the capital, Ankara, to meet with Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Pompeo said repeatedly that the Trump administration was withholding judgment until seeing the results of the Turkish and Saudi investigations."},{"role":"body","text":"“It’s reasonable to give them a handful of days to get it right,” he said of the Saudis."},{"role":"body","text":"“I do think it’s important that everyone keep in their mind that we have lots of important relations, financial relationships between U.S. and Saudi companies, government relationships, things that we work on all across the world,” he told reporters on his plane after leaving Ankara. “We just need to make sure that we are mindful of that as we approach decisions that the United States government will take when we learn all of the facts.”"},{"role":"body","text":"Mr. Trump, too, appeared inclined to trust the Saudis and denied that he was “giving cover” by insisting that they should be regarded as innocent until proven guilty."},{"role":"body","text":"Saudi Arabia “has been a very important ally,” Mr. Trump said. He noted again, as he has repeatedly since Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance, that the kingdom was spending billions of dollars on American weapons."},{"role":"body","text":"Still, the implication that the Saudi government orchestrated Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance and possible death has created a stigma around Crown Prince Mohammed, who runs the country."},{"role":"body","text":"His plan for a financial conference in Riyadh next week, dubbed Davos in the Desert, has been upended by cancellations from high-profile Western financiers and media organizations. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on Wednesday became the latest to scrap plans to attend."},{"role":"body","text":"In Istanbul, Turkish investigators were allowed to search the residence of the Saudi consul on Wednesday, 15 days after Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance. The Turks have repeatedly pressed for access to the premises, and they were accompanied on Wednesday by a team of Saudis."},{"role":"body","text":"Former United States intelligence officials have said they consider their Turkish counterparts both competent and credible when it comes to domestic intelligence gathering, and it would not be surprising if the Turks possessed audio surveillance from within the Saudi Consulate."},{"role":"body","text":"The Turkish news media has less credibility. Turkish media outlets and newspapers are either government-controlled or owned by pro-government business executives. Censors are often present in newsrooms, and reporters and editors take close instructions from officials in the presidency."},{"role":"body","text":"Pro-government news organizations may publish incorrect information. But it is highly unlikely that they would publish information about a politically sensitive investigation without the consent of the authorities. So the resumption of disclosures about Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance is more likely to reflect a decision by the Turkish president than a burst of muckraking zeal."},{"role":"body","text":"On Wednesday night, The Post "},{"role":"body","text":"Matthew Rosenberg and Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting from Washington, and Rick Gladstone from New York."},{"role":"image","URL":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/world/18brexit1/18brexit1-threeByTwoSmallAt2X.jpg?quality=75\u0026auto=webp\u0026disable=upscale"},{"role":"image","URL":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/business/18TECHUSING06/18TECHUSING06-threeByTwoSmallAt2X-v2.jpg?quality=75\u0026auto=webp\u0026disable=upscale"},{"role":"image","URL":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/world/18Turkey-recycling/merlin_145428237_f53b3320-c2e1-41ab-b059-15ab7dc25cd4-threeByTwoSmallAt2X.jpg?quality=75\u0026auto=webp\u0026disable=upscale"},{"role":"image","URL":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/world/18crimea-sub/18crimea-sub-threeByTwoSmallAt2X.jpg?quality=75\u0026auto=webp\u0026disable=upscale"},{"role":"image","URL":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/17/us/politics/pompeo/pompeo-threeByTwoSmallAt2X-v3.jpg?quality=75\u0026auto=webp\u0026disable=upscale"},{"role":"image","URL":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/business/oakImage-1539625163216/oakImage-1539625163216-threeByTwoSmallAt2X.jpg?quality=75\u0026auto=webp\u0026disable=upscale"},{"role":"body","text":"Advertisement"}],"documentStyle":{"backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF"},"componentTextStyles":{"default":{"fontName":"ArialMT","fontSize":17,"lineHeight":24,"linkStyle":{"textColor":"#326891"}},"default-author":{"fontName":"Arial-BoldMT","fontSize":12,"lineHeight":16},"default-body":{"fontName":"ArialMT","fontSize":17,"lineHeight":25},"default-caption":{"fontName":"ArialMT","fontSize":12,"lineHeight":15},"default-heading1":{"fontName":"Georgia","fontSize":48,"lineHeight":48},"default-heading2":{"fontName":"Georgia","fontSize":46,"lineHeight":46},"default-heading3":{"fontName":"Georgia","fontSize":44,"lineHeight":44},"default-heading4":{"fontName":"Georgia","fontSize":38,"lineHeight":38},"default-heading5":{"fontName":"Georgia","fontSize":36,"lineHeight":36},"default-heading6":{"fontName":"Georgia","fontSize":30,"lineHeight":30},"default-title":{"fontName":"Georgia","fontSize":44,"lineHeight":46}},"componentLayouts":{"default-author":{"columnSpan":7,"columnStart":0,"contentInset":{}},"default-body":{"columnSpan":7,"columnStart":0,"contentInset":{}},"default-caption":{"columnSpan":0,"columnStart":0,"contentInset":{}},"default-gallery":{"columnSpan":0,"columnStart":0,"contentInset":{}},"default-section":{"columnSpan":8,"columnStart":0,"contentInset":{},"ignoreDocumentMargin":"true"},"default-title":{"columnSpan":8,"columnStart":0,"contentInset":{}},"default-tweet":{"columnSpan":0,"columnStart":0,"contentInset":{}}}}
